We’d like to make this process more efficient by either knowing which projects to bid on or gaining insight into
why we’ve won the projects that we have in the past. With this information, we could make more informed
decisions on whether or not to invest time and money in bidding on different projects. We are asking your
consultant group to build a model to predict the probability of our company winning a project bid.
