Time Series Hw#2
The US Department of Agriculture’s program on Water, Sustainability and Climate (hereafter the"client”)
is seeking proposals for predicting monthly well water height.The scope of services includes
the following:
```{r}
install.packages('forecast',dependencies = T)
install.packages('tseries')
install.packages(c('expsmooth','lmtest','zoo','seasonal','haven','fma'))
library(forecast)
library(haven)
library(fma)
library(expsmooth)
library(lmtest)
library(zoo)
library(seasonal)
file.dir <- "C:/Users/Laney/Documents/Data/"
input.file1 <- "file1"
data <- read.csv(paste(file.dir, input.file1,sep = ""))

```
 Creation of a monthly ESM forecast with using the last 6 months as a test set to demonstrate the accuracy of the model.
```{r}
# Creating Time Series Data Objects #
time_Series <- ts(data, start = 1990, frequency = 12)
#smoothing model#

```
Creation of easy to read and interpret visualizations of the following:
-Actual well water values overlaid with the trend/cycle for the training set.
-Actual well water values overlaid with the seasonally adjusted water values for the
training set.
-For the trend/cycle and seasonal breakdown, indicate whether classical or STL
decomposition was used and why this technique was chosen.
```{r}
#plot functions#

```
Plot of the predicted versus actual for the test data.
```{r}
```
-The client’s analysts are open to either additive or multiplicative ESM’s; However, the reasons
for choosing either must be clearly stated and supported.
-The client uses Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in calculating the accuracy of its
forecasts; Report this measure for the 6 monthly forecasted well water values; The client is open
to other measurements in addition to the MAPE as long as they are clearly stated and
supported.
```{r}
#####Using a holdout data set:Example with error#
training=subset(Passenger,end=length(Passenger)-12)
test=subset(Passenger,start=length(Passenger)-11)
HWES.USAir.train <- hw(training, seasonal = "multiplicative",initial='optimal')
test.results=forecast(HWES.USAir.train,h=12)

error=test-test.results$mean
MAE=mean(abs(error))
MAPE=mean(abs(error)/abs(test))
```
